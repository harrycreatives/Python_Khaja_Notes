<meta name="description" content="Object Oriented Programming Lets assume we want to learn car driving Know everything: Understand how car engine works, ac works Or will you try to operate car using the abstractions like steering, dashboard, clutch, accelarator etc. Steering hides the complexity of rotating tyres and gives you simple abstracted interface. When we humans learn to use objects we use the abstracted interfaces. When we try to design program’s/applications why don’t we follow this approach? This thought process has led to object-oriented programming. Generally anything or everything is an object. Every object will have contents (What it has or what it is made of) and characteristics (What it can do). Lets take television as an example: contents: screen hdmi ports usb ports motherboard characteristics: playmovies connect to satellite channels Lets take car as an example: contents: engine wheels dashboard characteristics: start_the_engine commute stop_the_engine Lets take bank account as an example: contents: account holders name account id address balance characteristics: deposit_amount withdraw_amount transfer_amount pay_bills When we work on object-oriented programming we call contents as members and characteristics as methods. Members represent data and methods represent behaviors. Generally when we think of system we will have multiple objects. The following are major relations Inheritance: What does it mean Captian America is a soldier or Stark is an engineer or car is a vehicle. In this relation we have two objects parent object (soldier/engineer/Vehicle) and child objects (Captian America, Stark, car) which have same contents or capabilities/behaviors as a parent. Inheritance in simple is a relation that can be expressed as is a relationship. Composition: What does it mean by Bus has a driver or wall has a clock or laptop has a webcam. In one object other object is composed/present. When any relationship b/w two objects can be expressed as has a, it is Composition. The design time entity of object is called as class. We use class to create multiple objects. Classes are design time entities and Objects are runtime entities." />

<h3 id="terms">Terms</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Object Oriented Analysis (OOA):
    <ul>
      <li>We will look into real world problem and analyze the problem and write requirements with objects into consideration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Object Oriented Design (OOD):
    <ul>
      <li>From the requirements we create a design (UML) with objects and their relationships.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS):
    <ul>
      <li>Implementation of the design created by OOD in some object-oriented language like C#, Java, Python etc…</li>
