### Relationships (contd..)
* Describe Object Oriented stuff diagrammatically we use UML (Unified Modelling Language)
* I have oranges and i can place oranges in a basket
  * Orange is an object
  * Basket is an object
* There is a relationship b/w basket and oranges
* To represent in basic class diagram

* When we specify a relationship b/w oranges and basket it is many oranges in one basket (many to one)

* Now lets try cardinality between bus and a conductor

* Line between two classes is association & numbers at the end of the line represent cardinality
* Sample class diagram looks like (note this is not completely correct version)

### Lets try to design objects and their relationships in a library.
* This library has
  * Books
  * DVDs
  * Magazines
  * CDs
* The user are librarian and readers. Librarian gives a unique number (lib_id)
* Librarian needs to locate the library items
* Readers will also be given catalog where they can search for existence of book or not
* Lets think of different classes
  * Book
  * DVD
  * Magazine
  * CD
  * Shelf
  * Catalog
* Now lets speak normal english to come up with design
  * Book is a LibraryItem
  * DVD is a LibraryItem
  * Magazine is a LibraryItem
  * CD is a LibraryItem
  * Shelf has LibraryItemâ€™s
* Now the diagrammatic representation will be something like

### Exercise:
* Create a diagram as shown above for the following problem statement
* A Bank has a savings account, fixed deposit account, recurring deposit account and loan accounts
* Bank Manager/Accountant would like to search with an account number using Account Console
* Customers should be able to see account balance, last transactions
* Also represent Transactions in the diagram.
