### Problem to be solved
* Have a conversation with Jarvis to find if the given number is pallindrome
```
if you give 353 to jarvis he should output pallendrome
if you give 100 to jarvis he should output not pallendrome
```

* Lets have conversation with Jarvis about reverse of number
```
reversenumber: (input number)
Hi Jarvis, How are you doing
Rememeber 0 as reverse
Repeat till number is grater than 0
   calculate remainder = number%10
   calculate reverse = reverse*10 + remainder
   calculate number = number/10

return reverse
```

* Now lets check if the number is pallendrome
```
is_pallendrome:
Remember 101 as number1
check if number1 == reversenumber(number1)
  if yes show number1 is pallendrome
  else show number1 is not pallendrom

Remember 354 as number2
check if number2 == reversenumber(number2)
  if yes show number2 is pallendrome
  else show number2 is not pallendrom
```

### Personal finance Hint
* Look at power of compounding calculator [Here](https://www.moneycontrol.com/personal-finance/tools/magic-of-compounding-tool.html?classic=true)
* Programming Specific: Try to come up with converstion to get Jarvis calculate power of compounding for you. Duration: Take a week if you want.
* Plan: We will take this conversation and build a Calculator in Python once we become good at python
