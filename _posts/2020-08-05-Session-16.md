### Object Oriented Programming
* Lets assume we want to learn car driving
  * Know everything: Understand how car engine works, ac works

  * Or will you try to operate car using the abstractions like steering, dashboard, clutch, accelarator etc.

  * Steering hides the complexity of rotating tyres and gives you simple abstracted interface.
* When we humans learn to use objects we use the abstracted interfaces.
* When we try to design program’s/applications why don’t we follow this approach?
* This thought process has led to object-oriented programming.
* Generally anything or everything is an object.
* Every object will have __contents__ (What it has or what it is made of) and __characteristics__ (What it can do).
* Lets take television as an example:
```
contents: 
   screen
   hdmi ports
   usb ports
   motherboard
characteristics:
   playmovies
   connect to satellite channels
```
* Lets take car as an example:
```
contents:
    engine
    wheels
    dashboard
characteristics:
    start_the_engine
    commute
    stop_the_engine
```
* Lets take bank account as an example:
```
contents:
    account holders name
    account id
    address
    balance
characteristics:
    deposit_amount
    withdraw_amount
    transfer_amount
    pay_bills
```
* When we work on object-oriented programming we call contents as __members__ and characteristics as __methods__.
* Members represent data and methods represent behaviors.
* Generally when we think of system we will have multiple objects.
* The following are major relations
    * Inheritance:
      * What does it mean __Captian America is a soldier__ or __Stark is an engineer__ or __car is a vehicle__.
      * In this relation we have two objects parent object (soldier/engineer/Vehicle) and child objects (Captian America, Stark, car) which have same contents or capabilities/behaviors as a parent.
      * Inheritance in simple is a relation that can be expressed as __is a__ relationship.
    * Composition:
      * What does it mean by __Bus has a driver__ or __wall has a clock__ or __laptop has a webcam__.
      * In one object other object is composed/present.
      * When any relationship b/w two objects can be expressed as __has a__, it is Composition.
* The design time entity of object is called as __class__. We use __class__ to create multiple objects.
* __Classes__ are design time entities and __Objects__ are runtime entities.

### Terms
* Object Oriented Analysis (OOA):
  * We will look into real world problem and analyze the problem and write requirements with objects into consideration.
* Object Oriented Design (OOD):
  * From the requirements we create a design (UML) with objects and their relationships.
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS):
  * Implementation of the design created by OOD in some object-oriented language like C#, Java, Python etc…
