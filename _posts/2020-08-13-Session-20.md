### Initializing the object
* Lets look at Point class which we have written so far
```python
class Point:
    def reset(self):
        self.x = 0
        self.y = 0
```
* If we don’t explicitly set x and y positions on Our point object, we have a broken point with not real positions, So better idea would be enforcing user to pass the values of x and y while instantiating object from class
* So in many object oriented languages we have a concept of constructor which is a special method that creates and initializes the object
* In Python we have a constructor & a initializer. We rarely use constructor and often use initializer
* In python whenever you come across methods with ```__method_name__```, these methods are known as magic methods or dunder (double underscore)
* Python initialization method is also a magic method and it has a name ```__init__```
* Lets use initialization in the Point code

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def reset(self):
        self.x = 0
        self.y = 0
    
    def print(self):
        print(self.x, self.y)

# To instantiate an object
p = Point(4,5)
p.print()
p.reset()
p.print()
```

* Even if the user doesn’t pass x,y values i want to set some default values

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def reset(self):
        self.x = 0
        self.y = 0
    
    def print(self):
        print(self.x, self.y)

# To instantiate an object
p = Point(4,5)
p.print()
p.reset()
p.print()

# Lets instantiate a new object with default arguments
print("printing default arguments based object")
new_point = Point()
new_point.print()
```

* In initialization after the object is created __init__ will be called to initialize the values
* Constructor in the case of the python is ```__new__```

### Explaining Classes
* Python supports writing documentation of your classes & methods using __docstrings__.
* Lets look at our program

```python
class Point:
    "Represents a point in two dimensional space"

    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0):
        """ Initialize the position of a new point. 
        x and y coordinates can be specified. 
        If they are not specified, point defaults to origin
        """
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def reset(self):
        """
        Resets the point back to origin: 0,0
        """
        self.x = 0
        self.y = 0
    
    def print(self):
        """
        Prints the co-ordinates
        """
        print(self.x, self.y)
```
* Now importing this code in the Python interactive shell and we can view the help of the class.

* There are document generators in Python which can create a html documentation of your classes when you write doc strings.
* [Refer Here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#:~:text=A%20docstring%20is%20a%20string,module%20should%20also%20have%20docstrings.) for official docstring documentation.
* Now lets debug our class in visual studio code. While debugging the classes we will use __Step into__ which will help in moving into functions/operations/behaviors while debugging
* Exercise: Create a class called as __Number__ which will have operations such as
  * is_even
  * is_prime
  * is_palindrome
 
```python
class Number:
    """ 
    This represents a number which has some operations 
    for mathematical convenience
    """

    def __init__(self, number=0):
        """
        Initializes number with value passed otherwise
        initializes to zero
        """
        pass

    def is_even(self):
        """
        This operation returns true if the number is even,
        false other wise
        """
        pass

    def is_prime(self):
        """
        This operation returns true if the number is prime,
        false other wise
        """
        pass

    def is_palindrome(self):
        """
        This operation returns true if the number is palindrome,
        false other wise
        """
        pass
```
