### Our Character Jarvis and his capabilities
![preview](../../../../assets/python04.png)

### Lets do one more problem solving with Jarvis
* Lets take help of jarvis to solve this problem [Refer Here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)
* But first lets take help of jarvis to print fibonacci series till 100
```
Hi Jarvis
remember 1 as number1 and print it
remember 2 as number2 and print it
rememer 0 as result 
Now start calculation till result <= 100
    result = number1 + number2 (Add number1 and number2 and store in result)
    print result
    number1 = number2 (Assign value of number2 to number1)
    number2 = result (Assign value of result to number2)
```

* We have only printed fibonnaci series

```
Hi Jarvis
remember 1 as number1 and print it
remember 2 as number2 and print it
rememer 0 as result 
remember 2 as sum
Now start calculation till result <= 4000000
    result = number1 + number2 (Add number1 and number2 and store in result)
    print result
    check if result%2 == 0 
      if yes add result to sum (sum = sum+result)
    number1 = number2 (Assign value of number2 to number1)
    number2 = result (Assign value of result to number2)

show output as sum sum
```
### Lets solve one more problem
* The problem is [over here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3)
* since Prime factor is difficult for jarvis, lets break this problem into
  * finding factors
  * finding if number is prime or not
* Lets get jarvis to find factors
```
Hi Jarvis
Remember 100 as number
Remember 2 as start_number
Repeat till start_number < number/2
   check if number%start_number == 0
      if yes print start_number
    increment start_number (start_number = start_number + 1)
```

* Lets get jarvis to find if number is prime number or not

```
Check_prime:
Hi Jarvis, Take n (3,5,6,7) as number_to_be_check
Remember 2 as index
Remember true as is_prime
Repeat till index < number_to_be_checked
  check if number_to_be_checked % index == 0
     if yes assign is_prime with false and return value
   increment index (index=index+1)

return is_prime
```

* Now lets combine both conversations
```
Hi Jarvis
Remember 13195 as number
Remember 13195/2 as start_number
Repeat till start_number > 1
   check if number%start_number == 0
      if yes and if check_prime(number) is true then print number and stop
    decrement start_number (start_number = start_number - 1)
```

### Exercise
* Have a conversation with Jarvis to find if the given number is pallindrome
```
if you give 353 to jarvis he should output pallendrome
if you give 100 to jarvis he should output not pallendrome
```
