### Dummy Library Project
* We are supposed to develop the Library in Python.
* This project will be used by librarian, faculty, students.
* As of now Library has
  * Books
  * Magazines
  * DVD’s
  * E-books
* You have to implement the functionality to support the whole library activities.
* To implement this kind of project we might need to deal with lot of objects.
* We would be defining/writing the code in multiple **py** files.
* So how should i organize the multiple **py** files.
* **Modules** are simply python files. so each python file is a module.
* So to develop the library application i will end up creating multiple **modules**.
  
### Lets look at multi module demo
* Lets create a new folder moduledemo and in that create two python files app.py and database.py
* Each file is a module. so in database.py add the following code.

```python
class Database:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def connect(self):
        pass

    def disconnect(self):
        pass
```

* Now in app.py i want to create a database connection, so we need to create a object and then call method.
* To use Class Database in app.py we need to import modules. Importing modules in python can be done by import statement
* Using import statement i can import module or specific classes or functions from module.
* Importing complete module

```python
import database

db = database.Database()
db.connect()
```

* Importing specific class
  
```python
from database import Database

db = Database()
db.connect()
db.disconnect()
```

* Now lets create one more module called as utils.py

```python
class DbUtils:
    pass

class FileUtils:
    pass

class HttpUtils:
    pass
```

* Now lets assume if app.py module wants FileUtils and HttpUtils
  
```python
from utils import FileUtils, HttpUtils

# instantiating Objects of FileUtils
file_utils = FileUtils()

# instantiating Objects of HttpUtils
http_utils = HttpUtils()
```

* Some sources say that we will be importing all the classes and functions from the module using this syntax (Don’t do this)

```
from utils import *
```

* As number of **modules** grow it would be logical to organize **modules** in some folders based on usage
* A package is a collection of **modules** in a folder. The name of the **package** is name of folder
* Lets create three packages called as
  * common
  * utilities
  * models

* The package will be shown in pycharm as

* We need to tell python that folder is a package to distinguish it from other folders. To do this we would be a file in the folder ```__init__.py```
* This file can be empty. If we forget this file, we wont be able to import modules from that folder.
* So now lets create some modules in package common
* Absolute imports specify the complete path to the module, function or class we want to import.
