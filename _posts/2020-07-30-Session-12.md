### Conditional Statements
* If you consider the code
```
print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)
print(6)
print(7)
print(8)
print(9)
print(10)
```
* Python will execute all the lines one after other, now lets try to write a program which will tell if the number is even or odd.
* Lets go back to Jarvis:
```Hi Jarvis
Remember 10 as number
check if 10%2 == 0
if yes show 10 is even
else show 10 is odd
```
* Now part of the program still under-construction is as shown below
* To make it right we need to use if statement
* Now adding if to the program earlier
* This program looks ok but lets take dynamic input from user, now the program looks like
* Sample debugging screenshot

* Will we ever ask questions like
```
1. are you an engineer?
2. are you not an engineer?
```
* Then we have done the same thing in the above program?. To solve this i have if/else statement
```
if <condition>:
    <true-block>
else:
    <false block>
```
* Now our program look like
```python
number = int(input('Enter the number of your choice:  ')) # assignment statement

if number%2 == 0:
    print("you have chosen an even number")
else:
    print("you have chosen an odd number")
```
* Debug this program
* Now lets write a program which calculates average of 3 subjects and gives them grades
```
average = sub1+sub2+sub3/3

average >= 70 => distinction
average >=60 => first class
average >= 50 => second class
third class
```
* Now lets speak with jarvis to make our conversation with python3 simple
```
Hi jarvis
Take input from user and remember as maths
Take input from user and remember as physics
Take input from user and remember as chemistry
now calculate (maths+physics+chemistry)/3 and remember as average
when average >=70 print distinction
when average >=60 print first class
when average >= 50 print second class
for all other cases print third class
```
* So our program will be
```python
maths = int(input("Enter the marks obtained in maths:  "))
physics = int(input("Enter the marks obtained in physics:  "))
chemistry = int(input("Enter the marks obtained in chemistry:  "))
average = (maths+physics+chemistry)/3
if average >= 70:
    print("Distinction")
elif average >= 60:
    print("First class")
elif average >= 50:
    print("Second class")
else:
    print("Third class")
```
* Other way of solving this program could be
```python
maths = int(input("Enter the marks obtained in maths:  "))
physics = int(input("Enter the marks obtained in physics:  "))
chemistry = int(input("Enter the marks obtained in chemistry:  "))
average = (maths+physics+chemistry)/3
if average >= 70:
    print("Distinction")
else:
    if average >= 60:
        print("first class")
    else:
        if average>=50:
            print("second class")
        else:
            print("third class")
```
* One more of way
```python
maths = int(input("Enter the marks obtained in maths:  "))
physics = int(input("Enter the marks obtained in physics:  "))
chemistry = int(input("Enter the marks obtained in chemistry:  "))
average = (maths+physics+chemistry)/3
if average >= 70:
    print("Distinction")
if 60 <= average < 70:
    print("First class")
if 50 <= average < 60:
    print("second class")
if average < 50:
    print("third class")
```
