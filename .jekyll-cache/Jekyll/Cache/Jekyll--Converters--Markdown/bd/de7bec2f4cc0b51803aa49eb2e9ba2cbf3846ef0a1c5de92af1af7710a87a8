<h3 id="break-and-continue-statements-in-loops">break and continue statements in loops</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>break</strong> will exit the loop</li>
  <li><strong>continue</strong> will skip the step in current loop and go to the next iteration</li>
  <li>To understand break and continue execute this program in pythontutor.com
```python
index = 2
is_even = False
while index &lt;= 10000:
  if index%2 == 0:
      print(index)
      index = index+9
      continue
  elif index%3 == 0: 
      print(index)
  elif index%11 == 0:
      break
  index = index+1</li>
</ul>

<p>print(“i’m out of the loop”)</p>

### Now lets solve our Number guessing program
* Lets understand this program
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>we will tell python3 to remember a random number between some range (1,100)
then we will ask the user to enter his guess
if he has guessed the same number which python remembers he wins
if he guesses lower than random we will hint the user to guess high
else we will hint to guess low
we will do you accept defeat?, if user say yes we will stop &amp; show the number
else user continues guessing</p>

<p>Hi Jarvis
Remember a random number between 1 and 100 as lucky_number
continue till user accepts defeat or wins
   take input from user and remember it as guess
   if guess &lt; lucky_number hint user to guess high or accept defeat
   if guess &gt; lucky_number hint user to guess low or accept defeat
   if guess == lucky_number display congrats and stop execution.</p>
